RE6 Autosplitter for LiveSplit. Primary is for IGT only, will work on it later.

With boredom, lockdown, and nothing to do, I've finally followed through and made an autosplitter base for Resident Evil 6. If you don't know what an autosplitter is, what it does or can do, and don't run RE6, then this probably isn't for you.

Cliff notes?

|--Add via Scriptable Auto Splitter component in your Layout settings. Be sure to save your Layout.

|--Set the Comparison to Game Time (since the main release is IGT only). Be sure to save your Layout.

|--This is a work in progress, as it is my first autosplitter. Bugs, issues, whatever, just let me know and I'll see what I can do.

|--Have the skills to improve it? Feel free, just remember to give credit.

|--Automatic Splits and Load Removal require a bit more work, specifically memory identifiers for things like loading screens, map loads, etc. If you want to help and can find them, feel free to submit them for credit.


Have fun.
