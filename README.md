# RE6_ASL
RE6 Autosplitter for LiveSplit. IGT is done, will implement the optional chapter split later.

With boredom, lockdown, and nothing to do, I've finally followed through and made an autosplitter base for Resident Evil 6. If you don't know what an autosplitter is, what it does or can do, and don't run RE6, then this probably isn't for you.

Cliff notes?

|--Add via Scriptable Auto Splitter component in your Layout settings. Be sure to save your Layout.

|--Set your Timer Comparison to Game Time and save the Layout; this way, the timer will always be set to the right value!

|--This is a work in progress, as it is my first autosplitter. Bugs, issues, whatever, just let me know and I'll see what I can do.

|--Have the skills to improve it? Feel free, just remember to give credit.

|--Want Automatic splits, load removal, etc.? Then feel free to contribute! Pointers for isLoading, area loads, whatever you think would help. I could possibly find these on my own, but I am a noob. Cheat Engine and ASL gods are welcome!


Have fun.
